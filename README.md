# dog_vs_cat_classification


Here we are discussing the classification via convolution layer ...
We put there, is maximum 3 convolutonal layer which would help us to determine the process of classification between dogs and cat pictures....
Here if we get in the output like 1 intger number .... 
It means we get the dog features in the input image. 
In the opposite way we get the 0 ... then it means we have cat in the input image...


In that way our Machine learning based on classification using convolutional layer of features extracting .... is completes....

Thank You...
For your kind attentiom to the project.....
